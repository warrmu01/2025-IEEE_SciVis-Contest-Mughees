# 🔬 SciVis 2025 – AlloyExplorer

## 📖 Documentation

### 🔍 Overview

**AlloyExplorer** is a data-driven visualization project developed for the **IEEE SciVis 2025 Contest**. The goal is to explore and visually analyze a massive dataset of simulated aluminum alloy compositions derived from recycled engine pistons. These high-performance materials are evaluated on their structural, thermal, and mechanical properties to aid the discovery of new, sustainable alloys.

The project features:
- Multidimensional analysis of input–output relationships
- Dimensionality reduction techniques for pattern recognition
- Interactive visual exploration dashboards (Streamlit)
- Potential for integration with alloy optimization algorithms

### 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Notebook Layer**
  - Used for exploration, correlation mapping, and PCA/UMAP analysis
  - Identifies sensitivity of outputs to composition variations

- **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**
  - Enables material scientists to compare alloy candidates
  - Filters by performance traits like strength, phase stability, solidification
  - Visualizes microstructure–composition–property links

- **(Optional) Optimization Hooks**
  - Future integration with visual steering and optimizer-guided exploration

## 🔗 Core Tasks (from Contest)

### 🧪 Challenge 1: Alloy Space Exploration
- Visualize high-dimensional input-output relationships
- Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, UMAP)
- Map correlations across scrap mixtures and mechanical properties

### 🧬 Challenge 2: Optimization & Visual Steering

## 📉 Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

We use:
- **PCA** for linear variance capture
- **UMAP** for nonlinear structure preservation
- **t-SNE** (optional) for localized similarity mapping

These help reduce the 100+ parameter space to 2D/3D for easier interpretation and clustering.
