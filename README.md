# 🔬 SciVis 2025 – AlloyExplorer

## 📖 Documentation

### 🔍 Overview

**AlloyExplorer** is a data-driven visualization project developed for the **IEEE SciVis 2025 Contest**. The goal is to explore and visually analyze a massive dataset of simulated aluminum alloy compositions derived from recycled engine pistons. These high-performance materials are evaluated on their structural, thermal, and mechanical properties to aid the discovery of new, sustainable alloys.

The project features:
- Multidimensional analysis of input–output relationships
- Dimensionality reduction techniques for pattern recognition
- Interactive visual exploration dashboards (Streamlit)
- Potential for integration with alloy optimization algorithms

### 🏗️ System Architecture

- **Notebook Layer**
  - Used for exploration, correlation mapping, and PCA/UMAP analysis
  - Identifies sensitivity of outputs to composition variations

- **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**
  - Enables material scientists to compare alloy candidates
  - Filters by performance traits like strength, phase stability, solidification
  - Visualizes microstructure–composition–property links

- **(Optional) Optimization Hooks**
  - Future integration with visual steering and optimizer-guided exploration
