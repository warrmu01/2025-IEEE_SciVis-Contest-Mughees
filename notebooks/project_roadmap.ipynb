    "## 🔰 Phase 1: Understanding the Problem & Dataset ✅ *(I have mostly done this!)*\n",
    "**Goal:** Grasp what the dataset represents and what the competition is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Download and clean the dataset\n",
    "- ✅ Understand the column groups:\n",
    "  - 6 scrap alloy input ratios\n",
    "  - 12 resulting element compositions\n",
    "  - 38 microstructure features\n",
    "  - 14 physical/mechanical/thermal properties\n",
    "- ✅ Read background info & challenges\n",
    "- ✅ Perform EDA (distributions, correlations, pairplots)\n",

    "## 🔍 Phase 2: Define Use Cases (Scenarios) 🔄 *(I am doing this now)*\n",
    "**Goal:** Choose real-world applications to guide alloy optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenarios:\n",
    "- Aerospace  \n",
    "- Automotive  \n",
    "- Power Generation  \n",
    "- Additive Manufacturing  \n",
    "- E-Mobility Battery Enclosures  \n",
    "- 🆕 Utility Infrastructure (e.g., power lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each scenario:**\n",
    "- Define key target properties (e.g., high YS + conductivity for power)\n",
    "- List “good alloy” criteria\n",

    "## 📊 Phase 3: Global Visualization (Challenge 1 - Task 1) 🔜\n",
    "**Goal:** Reveal patterns in full dataset (alloy design → performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) on:\n",
    "  - Compositions only\n",
    "  - Microstructure only\n",
    "  - All features together\n",
    "- Plot colored by application-relevant outputs (e.g., YS, CSC, Thermal Conductivity)\n",
    "- Create parallel coordinate plots for top vs. worst-performing alloys\n",
    "- Highlight trends and clusters in composition–property relationships\n",

    "## 🔎 Phase 4: Candidate Exploration Tool (Challenge 1 - Task 2)\n",
    "**Goal:** Enable interactive exploration of alloy trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a dashboard (e.g., with Plotly Dash, Streamlit, or Jupyter Widgets):\n",
    "  - Filter by property ranges (e.g., YS > 300 MPa)\n",
    "  - Select application and highlight suitable alloys\n",
    "  - Show stats and charts for selected alloys\n",
    "- Add:\n",
    "  - Top-N alloys for each use case\n",

    "**Goal:** Visualize how to *change inputs* to improve alloy designs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity Analysis:**\n",
    "  - Which input % or element affects YS, CSC, conductivity the most?\n",
    "  - Use partial dependence plots or SHAP values\n",
    "- **Volatility Analysis:**\n",
    "  - Where do small composition changes cause large output shifts?\n",
    "- **Visualization:**\n",
    "  - Use heatmaps, ridge plots, or slider-based simulations to show \"what-if\" changes\n",
    "  - Add annotations to steer toward better regions\n",
